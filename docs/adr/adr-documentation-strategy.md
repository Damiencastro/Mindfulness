## Folder Purpose:
- This folder will hold the "WHY" decisions are made.
## Contents:
- A collection of short, numbered documents, each explaining a single, significant techincal decision. This is where you document *why* you chose one path over another.
## Dry Boundary:
- This folder does *not* explain the final architecture; it only explains the *justificiation* for a key piece of it.
