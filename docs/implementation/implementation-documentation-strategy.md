# Implementation - Documentation Strategy

## Folder Purpose:
- This folder is the "DEV README".

## Contents:
- Logistics for a developer to get the project running. Build steps, coding standards, and debugging help.

## DRY Boundary:
- This is not about the app's design, but the *logistics* of working on it.

## Files

- `build-setup.md`: A document describing the build utilities, required libraries, etc.
- `troubleshooting.md`: A document to track comprehensive debugging for future reference on issues.
- `testing-strategy.md`: A document to track overall testing strategy and individual tests and their statuses.
