# Design - Documentation Strategy

## Folder Purpose:
- This folder holds the "USER STORY."

## Contents:
- All documents related to the *user's* experience. It's requirements, user-facing logic, and use cases.

## DRY Boundary:
- This folder should never hold implementation or technical details. It's "implementation-agnostic" and focuses on what the user wants to achieve.

## Files

- `game-session-logic.md`: Defines how the user interacts to create game sessions, and how they interact with dialogs.
- `requirements.md`: Defines the exact requirements of the product.
- `ui-flow-and-ux.md`: Defines the user's ui flow of the product and how to streamline and minimize obstrusiveness.
- `use-cases.md`: Defines the various cases in which the product will be used, explaining *who* the user is, *what* they want from the product, and *why* they want it.
